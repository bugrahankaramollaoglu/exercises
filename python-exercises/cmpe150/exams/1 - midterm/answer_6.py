""" You have a stock that is increasing in value insanely.
Your stocks increases in value by 1% everyday, meaning that:
If your stock is â‚º100 on day 0, it values 100*%1 = 101 on day 1, and it values
101*%1 = 102,01 on day 2.
Your stock increases in value 2% every weekend day.
Your stock increases in value 5% every month.
Your stock increases in value 10% every year.
Write a program that takes a float (initial value of your stock) and an integer (day).
The program must calculate the value of your stock at the given day.
When increasing in value on a day, the stock can increase by only one type of rule,
and the maximum increment is applied.
You start from day zero on 31th December night which is coincidentally Sunday too.
Weeks pass every 7 days; months pass every 30 days and years pass every 365 days.
