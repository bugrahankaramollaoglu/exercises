This repository contains example Python code for free lessons posted on the Portfolio Courses YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/PortfolioCourses

The code examples are from the Python Examples playlist specifically:

Comments have been added to the code to try to explain things, but the code should make much more sense after watching the relevant lesson.  A link to the relevant YouTube video is posted with each file/folder.
