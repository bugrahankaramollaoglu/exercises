# Python Design Patterns Example Code

This folder contains example code for free design patterns with Python lessons posted on the Portfolio Courses YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CukrRuOAVqg&list=PLA1FTfKBAEX6GsXyPkkmNKpTRkMwNR0ik

Comments have been added to the code to try to explain things, but the code should make much more sense after watching the relevant lesson.  A link to the relevant YouTube video is posted with each file/folder.
