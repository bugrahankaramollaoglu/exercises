# Python Anti-Patterns Example Code

This folder contains example code for free anti-patterns in Python lessons posted on the Portfolio Courses YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1FTfKBAEX7oeBFA1Q7Z7IQbFlNQkglQ

Comments have been added to the code to try to explain things, but the code should make much more sense after watching the relevant lesson.  A link to the relevant YouTube video is posted with each file/folder.
